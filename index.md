The Emotion Phenomenology and Physiology Modeling Coopetition (EPPMC) is an emotion modeling coopetition designed to evaluate and improve researchers’ ability to model emotional experience from measures of physiology. <br>

Researchers will first <b>compete</b> to see who can best use measures of physiology to model moment-to-moment ratings of two elementary components of emotional experience: feelings of valence and arousals. Afterwards, these same researchers will <b>collaborate</b> to describe their results and brainstorm how to improve the accuracy and generalizability of emotion recognition research.

        <h3>Competitor Selection</h3>
        Researchers can apply to participate in the challenge if they (a) have significant experience in machine learning, and (b) are currently affiliated with an academic institution.<br><br>12 applicants will be chosen to participate in the challenge, and these competitors will receive a small stipend at the end of the challenge.

        <h3>Database Distribution</h3>
        Competitors will be given four emotion modeling challenges. For each challenge, they will be asked to model moment-to-moment self-report ratings of valence and arousal using 8 moment-to-moment physiology recordings (e.g., electrocardiography, galvanic skin response, and skin temperature).

        <h3>Model Development and Testing</h3>
        Competitors will be challenged to obtain the best model fit, operationalized as the minimization of mean squared error in test subsets of the data. Model testing will involve a combination of k-fold and hold-out cross-validation.<br><br>Afterwards, competitors will make their code openly available for checking by other competitors.

        <h3>Result Dissemination</h3>
        Challengers and competition organizers will co-author a manuscript. This manuscript will describes the challenge results, challenge limitations, and future directions for improving the accuracy and generalizability of emotion recognition research.

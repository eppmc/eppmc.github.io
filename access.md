**We are striving to make the 2022 Big Team Science Conference as accessible as possible. Please [contact us](mailto:bigteamscienceconference@gmail.com) as soon as possible if you have any questions about accessibility or would like to notify us of accessibility needs.** 

## Conference platform

We will be using Zoom as our primary conference platform. 

## Slide sharing

We encourage speakers to share their presentation slides, with as much annotation as possible, in advance of their talks.

## Note to all attendees

We aim to make this conference a welcoming, inclusive event. As an attendee, you play a very important role in this. We are a neurodiverse community, and we don’t all communicate and express ourselves the same way. Some people prefer direct, literal communication and others talk in idioms and metaphors. Some people need extra time to process and respond. Communication is a two-way process, so let’s be flexible and accommodate different communication styles. Sometimes a person may need to leave in the middle of a session, or flap their hands, or pace up and down, or go to a quiet space, and that’s ok. So if someone’s behavior seems strange to you, don’t make assumptions – talk to them directly... Raise your hand and ask the presenter to describe what’s happening in their silent video, for the benefit of those who can’t see it. These are the actions that add up to a truly inclusive event where we all feel welcome.  Let’s make this conference an amazing experience for everyone.<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1" title="link to footnote">[1]</a>

Notes:
- accessible conference guide: http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/#website
- At the start of the conference, if there are attendees in the audience with vision impairments, remind presenters that all slides, videos and visual demos will need to be described as part of the spoken presentation. Session chairs can help re-enforce this.
- Work with the proceedings publishers to ensure that the index and table of contents of the electronic proceedings are available in an accessible format. If they are html, the W3C WCAG 2.0 guidelines apply. For pdf documents, the Adobe Acrobat accessibility check applies (see resources below for more information about creating accessible pdf documents).
- Work with the proceedings chairs to ensure that accepted conference submissions are made accessible. The publishers Sheridan can also help with this if requested.
- Encourage authors to caption videos that will be released by the conference.
